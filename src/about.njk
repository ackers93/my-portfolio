    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a passionate full-stack developer with 5+ years of experience building web applications that make a difference. Currently working as a Software Engineer at the Department of Defense, where I develop and maintain critical web applications using Ruby on Rails, React, and cloud technologies.</p>
    
    <p>I founded Ventura Coast Web Design LLC, where I deliver modern, responsive websites and enhanced Google Business presence for local clients. I'm passionate about security-first development, CI/CD pipelines, and creating scalable solutions that solve real-world problems, allowing me to work remotely from my home in Ventura, California.</p>
