      <p>
        Hi I'm Andrew, I'm a full-stack web developer with a particular interest
        in front-end development. My specialties include Javascript, React,
        Node, Express and Ruby on Rails.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm spent most of my professional life working in Construction, which I
        believe has helped me create a strong work ethic and ability to work
        with a wide range of tasks. I also used to be in charge of training
        apprentices which helped create a passion for passing my skills on to
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from tech, my passions include hiking, traveling, reading
        non-fiction and cooking.
      </p>
    </div>
