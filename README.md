at first glance, I like how clean it looks, and how everything comes together is kinda cute
I like how everything is in one page. It is very easy to glance all the information need in a few second
Navigation doesn't take you to certain section, but that should be an easy fix
Responsiveness on different screens could use some more love
i love skills section. I think you did great with the icon and interaction when you hover your mouse over it, :good-job:
although I am personally not a fan of the background color as is and how it comes together with the current page
I also could not scroll down to the end of it
I am personally also not a fan of the current header. Could use some more styling and flare on your name and what you do
I think you did excellent with laying out content in projects section. very easy to follow and it has all the info you pretty much need, including the link :omiya-yay:
project cards gave me the impression that I could just click on it, and it would just flip. didn't expect the click for more info :thinking_face:
I'd think blog section could use a little bit of interactive content, like maybe Read More... button, or changing link text color over hover, etc.
same for contact section.

Nice!!! :smile: I like the yellow being the pop of color! On my screen, the nav bar is cut off on the top and bottom so you can't see the top of your "AA" and bottom of skills. The Projects title looks a little lonely being the only title being left-aligned but maybe that's just me
